## Rules of the Game
Your goal is to get as close to 21 with your cards as you can, but not above. Before the game starts, you place your **BET**. Once the game has started, you are delt two cards. The house gets two cards as well, however one of them stays face down. You now have two options.
**HIT**: receive an additional card
**STAND**: keep current hand

You can **HIT** as often as you want. But be carefull! Once your hand is above 21... **BUST**! You lost!

**BUST**: 21 exceeded. 
**BET**: Money used in a round

Once you decide you are close enough to 21 you **STAND**. This means, you don't want any new cards. When all players **STAND** the house will reveal its one face down card. The house then keeps drawing cards until it has 17 or higher. If you are higher than the house but not above 21 you **WIN**. If the house is higher than you you **LOSE**.

**BLACKJACK** is a special occasion where a player has 21 with the first two cards. The player then wins immediately unless the house also reaches 21. In that case it's a **TIE**.
